    <string name="rules_content"><![CDATA[<h1> Card values ​​</h1>
        <p>
            Cards from two to ten (2 - 10) have the value indicated on the card.
            The cards J (jack), Q (queen) and K (king) have a value of 10,
            card A (ace) has a value of 1 (there is a change, the player cannot decide what value the card will have).
        </p>

    <h1> Goal of the game </h1>
        <p>
            The principle of the game is the same, namely that the player wants to collect cards in a value closer to the total sum of 21 cards than the dealer, but must not exceed this value.
            A player whose sum of cards exceeds 21. is eliminated from the game and loses.
            In the case of the same number of player and croupier points, the game is a draw and no one wins.
        </p>

    <h1> Game progress </h1>
        <ol>
            <li>At the beginning of each game, you have to choose a bet and then the dealer starts dealing cards.</li>
            <li>At the beginning of each round, the dealer deals two cards to the player and gives him one card.</li>
            <li>After the cards are dealt, the player has the option of 2 actions:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>get another card (Hit),</li>
                <li>let dealer turn (Stand),</li>
                <li>other options such as Split and Double are not possible.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

    <h1> The croupier and his game </h1>
        <p>
           In normal Blackjack, the dealer has certain rules on how to play:
            <ul>
                <li>deal another card if the sum of his cards is less than 17,</li>
                <li>stay standing when the sum of his cards is 17 and higher.</li>
            </ul>
            For this game, however, I opted for my own algorithm, which is based on the probability and chance of another card falling.
